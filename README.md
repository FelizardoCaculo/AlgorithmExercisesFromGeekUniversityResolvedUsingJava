## Getting Started

I'm creating this project to train my personal skills by solving 300 exercises from the "Geek University" list of exercises, i am using Java programing language to create the algorithms. the other reason for me to create this project, is to shere the results with studants, and another people that are learning the Java programing language.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
